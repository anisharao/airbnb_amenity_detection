I asked Airbnb's top superhosts for their best tips on being the greatest host you can possibly be. So here's how to make more money on Airbnb, sourced directly from the people who've done it themselves.
tips to be a better host :

1. Be honest â€” people are happiest when you manage their expectations.
"If your place has challenges or weird little eccentricities, put them out there up front so that people can know what they're getting into. For example, my home has a number of stairs, so we are sure to feature pictures of them."

2. Be flexible with check-in and check-out time.
"That means they can count on us to have a smooth vacation no matter what flight or car delay they might encounter."

3. Give new folks a shot.
"I was at first reticent to rent to people who were new to the site and didn't have any previous reviews. But I still do it; I just make sure to probe a bit on why people are coming to town, what they're excited about in terms of your listing, and who they're bringing with them. It leads to some fun relationships, and hopefully some happy new Airbnb users!"

4. Always do a bit more than you promised in the listing.
"Whether you offer fresh coffee every morning, share your gym membership with your guest, or have a glass of wine with them one evening, just make sure to go the extra mile in some way.
For example, a guest asked if I had an iron and ironing board. I only had a steamer, but I went out and bought one for her the next day. It's a deductible business expense, something I and future guests will have use for, and she was delighted."

5. Send guests an email a week prior to their arrival.
"We make sure ours is personalized and includes a line or two based on the information the guests have shared about themselves. The first part is just information about the house. In the second part of the email, though, we go through information about the neighborhood, places to eat, cafes, gyms, and activities. Since we often get international visitors who don't always have access to data on their phones, they find this email very helpful. We've received appreciative messages and mentions of this email on our reviews."

6. Leave small explainer notes around all of the electronics.
"This way, guests know exactly what they need to do. I also tell them which light switches to use, and ask them to leave one on if necessary."

7. Ask them about their food preferences right when they book.
"I always email my guests right after they book to ask them how they take their coffee, and if they have any dietary restrictions. This lets them know it's going to be a special experience."

8. Leave your guests plenty of information on what to do in the area.
"We offer our guests a complete portable series of travel books, brochures, and menus of local attractions and restaurants. We also are always on the lookout for discount coupons that might save our guests some money during their stay. And we point them to places off the beaten path, too, that might be of interest based on our conversations about their likes and dislikes."

9. Whenever possible, greet guests at the door â€” and be sensitive to their needs when they first arrive.
"They are often stressed out, so be sensitive to that, and help put them at ease. Some have lots of questions; some just want to be left alone. If you can't read their body language, ask them if there's anything they need."

10. And offer to carry their belongings.
"Warm welcomes put people at ease. One time, a guest called from the subway exit and was looking for directions. I knew he had lots of luggage, so I went out and found him, took some of his bags, and escorted him to the apartment."

11. And then offer them a drink â€” or leave them a bottle of wine in their room for when they arrive.
"Depending on the time of day, I right away offer guests water, coffee, tea, beer, or a glass of wine. I usually have a bottle of red wine open."

12. Give them a quick tour.
"Or, if you're not there, leave them notes that explain where all the essential items are: towels, cleaning supplies, paper products, etc."

13. Have soft music playing when your guests arrive.
"It's a nice way to set the personality of your space. Personally, I turn on classical music for a relaxing atmosphere."

14. 16. Decorate your space with interesting art, furniture, and bedding.
"If the guests wanted to stay at a boring hotel, they would. We go to antique stores and unique furniture stores to give our house a memorable homey feel."

15. Use a key-less lock if you won't be there to greet them.
"We use a keypad that we set to a code that will be personal to the guest, which makes it easy for the guest to remember â€” and offers them the security knowing the guests before them do not have access. As a bonus, it allows for check-ins when you are not home, and no worries about lost keys!"

16. Keep it simple.
"You don't have to offer your guests elaborate gifts or have an elaborate home to be successful. A clean, cozy space that's free of clutter will make your guests feel most welcome."

17. Leave fresh flowers all around.
"We always pick flowers from our garden and leave them in the bedroom and bathroom. Small and pleasant details, plus an element of surprise, go a long way."

18. Invest in good ambient lighting.
"One of the best ways to set the mood and atmosphere of your space is with ambient lighting. This light makes the space warm and welcoming even if you are not there. By ambient lighting, I mean no overhead or harsh lights that cause shadows. Lighting should be soft white, not bright blue or fluorescent."

19. Clean! Clean! Clean!
"There is no better way to make a good impression than by giving each guest a meticulously cleaned accommodation. This means cleaning the shower, toilet, sink and floors after every guest."

20. Make sure there are blankets by the couch, books to read, and fun games to play.


21. Decorate your space for the holidays.
"During the holidays, we outfit the home with holiday decor so our guests feel more at home when traveling. We also leave all our guests a gift!"

22. If you live on site, invite your guests to join you for dinner if the vibe is right.
"As we see it, every guest is a potential new friend, and some have become just such. When the vibe is good, we have invited several Airbnb guests to join us for dinner at our table, sharing good food, wine and great stories."

23. Stock your house with snacks â€” the investment will pay off tenfold in your reviews.
"My community has some great local products, and I include them as part of the continental breakfast I leave for each guest. I stock freezer jam, homemade granola, honey, ice cream, and pastries all from local businesses, along with a few fresh local organic eggs."
"We always stock the Carriage house with snacks, such as individual bags of Boulder Chips, cookies, nuts, and crackers. We also leave a couple cans of Izzy Juice, a small bottle of Prosecco, a small bottle of OJ, a couple waters and a few local beers for every guest. It's an easy and cheap way to make the place just a bit more special."

24. Leave your guests with all of the supplies they need.
"We always have extra toothpaste, toothbrushes, disposable razors and cotton swabs. Most guests won't use them, but for the guest who gets in at 10 p.m. only to figure out they forgot a toothbrush, it will make their stay."

25. And be sure to leave extras of everything, too.
Because sometimes, one set of towels is not enough. "Extra amounts of items like light bulbs, extra bath towels, extra pillows, extra blankets, extra toilet paper, extra boxes of tissue so they don't run out during their stay."

10 tips on how to be a good Airbnb host
Apr 21, 2018 | Jennifer Sokolowsky

Short-term vacation rentals offer an opportunity for people to make money by welcoming guests into their homes. Since it was founded in 2008, the popularity of Airbnb rentals has continued to grow, reaching more than 6 million listings in more than 191 countries with more than 500 million guest arrivals to date.
In this competitive landscape â€” where good reviews and references are crucial to a successful vacation rental business â€” you need to provide your guests with a top-notch experience. Airbnb hosting is a business, but it depends on being a good host, which â€” if done right â€” is an art.
Here are 10 tips on how to be a great Airbnb host and create a five-star experience for your guests.
1. Make it personal
Your personal interaction with guests can make the difference between a so-so stay and a memorable experience. Try to get to know a little about your guests before their stay and make it clear that youâ€™re available to answer any questions they might have about the Airbnb or the area. Greeting them upon arrival to make sure theyâ€™re settling in well can help establish a personal relationship and provide an opportunity to make sure they have everything they need for a wonderful stay. Even leaving a note to welcome them can work to create a much more personal experience.
2. Keep it clean
Your Airbnb should be absolutely clean for guests, every time. This means the bathroom should be spotless, wastebaskets should be empty, there should be no dust anywhere, and there should be no sign of previous guests. If you have a cleaning service, it can be a good practice to have a checklist of things that need to be done during each cleaning to make sure nothing gets neglected.
3. Keep it simple
Keep clutter to a minimum. You want your Airbnb to feel like a home, but not make it so personal that guests feel like theyâ€™re intruding. Steer away from displaying family photos and keep closets and drawers clear of personal belongings. The idea is to give offer guests a space where they can spread out, relax, and truly feel at home.
4. Keep guests informed
Offering your guests as much information as possible before and during their stay can help create a smoother experience. Provide very clear instructions upon check-in and house rules before they arrive so they can know what to expect. Once they arrive, it should be very easy for guests to find instructions for equipment such as stereo systems or fireplaces, contact information if they should have a question or need help, checkout procedures, and anything else that might need explanation.
5. Help guests explore
Acting as a personal concierge for your guests is a valuable service. You may offer to recommend restaurants or point them to attractions and activities in the area. It can be helpful to write these kinds of recommendations down so your guests can peruse at their leisure. Another nice touch is to stock the property with books or guides on the area. Airbnb guests are often looking to get to know the area in a way they would not be able to do if they were staying in a hotel. Help them live like a local.
6. Anticipate needs
When furnishing your Airbnb, think about what your guests will need for a smooth stay. In the kitchen, this can mean making sure you have enough dishes to accommodate your Airbnbâ€™s maximum group size; supplying enough different kinds of pots, pans, and utensils to allow guests to prepare a variety of meals; and stocking basic pantry items like paper towels, oil, salt, sugar, and spices. In bathrooms, it could mean making sure there are enough towels for the maximum group size, a good stock of toilet paper, and hair dryers in each bathroom. Have a pool or Jacuzzi or a beach nearby? Stock beach towels. Think about how your guests will use your Airbnb and what you can do to make sure everything is waiting for them.
7. Go beyond basics
What distinguishes a great host, however, is going beyond basic needs. Is your Airbnb in wine country? Make sure you supply good-quality wine glasses. Offering thick, fluffy towels in the bathroom adds a little touch of luxury â€” especially if you offer high-end toiletries as well. Have a gourmet kitchen? Make sure the knives are sharp and that pots and pans are of high quality. And nothing brings raves like good-quality beds with soft, comfortable sheets.
8. Little things matter
Small gestures can have a big impact for your guests. When you welcome your guests with a complimentary bottle of wine or deliver scones to their door for breakfast, for example, the small cost is far outweighed by how this gesture makes your guests feel about your Airbnb. Itâ€™s the unexpected, thoughtful touches that can really set your Airbnb apart from the competition.
9. Be responsive
Part of offering personal service is simply being available whenever your guests might need something â€” from the moment they inquire about the property until itâ€™s time for them to check out. Itâ€™s crucial to respond quickly to potential guests who are interested in your Airbnb; if you donâ€™t get back to them right away, another property owner might. That responsiveness should continue throughout their stay. If you arenâ€™t locally available, designate a local contact who guests can call with any questions or in case of an emergency, and make sure that number is posted prominently on the property.
10. If something goes wrong, make it right
If something goes wrong during a guestâ€™s stay â€” and things will go wrong, from plumbing issues to miscommunication â€” make it right. That could mean an abject apology or a partial refund, but the way you handle a problem can create a good review out of a bad situation.
Be the host with the most
As an Airbnb operator, youâ€™re in the hospitality business, and that means putting your guests first. Guests recognize when you make an effort to provide them with an exceptional experience â€” and theyâ€™ll want to share that experience with others.
